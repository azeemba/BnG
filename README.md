You need node and npm to run grunt. 

After getting those, you should run 'npm install' inside the directory and it will install grunt and all the different dependencies locally.

After that, you should be able to do 'grunt build' whenever you want to build the extension.

The build should create a dist/ directory. In chrome, you can go to extension and click on "Load Unpacked Extension" and go to the dist/ directory and load in the extension to test.
